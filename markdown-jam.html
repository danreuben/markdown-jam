<h2 id="entrance">1 - Entrance</h2>
<p>Large wall sconces flank faded taspestries along the West wall. Each tapestry depicts a god figure in discinct themes of action, horror, and romance. A deep groove cut into the tile floor arcs out from the South wall where a skeleton is found clutching a piece of gold leafed parchment. A silent alarm signals the occupant of the workshop (4a) when disturbed via a near invisble filiment connected to the skeleton’s hand. An obsidian door with a pearl handle is set into the East wall.</p>

<h2 id="parlor">2 - Parlor</h2>
<p>The room is dimly lit and contains multiple seating areas of various configurations atop large mismatched rugs. A mirror backed bar spans the East wall. Mannequins are positioned individually in the acts of libation, dance, and conversation throughout the room.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-maker">Puppet Maker</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Puppet Maker resides in the workshop (4a). They will attempt to take position disguised as an additional mannequin in the parlor (2) while the show plays out in the theater (3a). If threatened they retreat back to the workshop (4a) and lock the door. In defense the Puppet Maker will activate their ultimate creation resting on the altar (4b).</p>

<h2 id="a---theater">3a - Theater</h2>
<p>The room is dark. Upon entering light projects from the ceiling onto the North wall revealing a surreal scene of brightly painted characters carved into wooden panels. The East corridor and beyond is not visible unless investgated with a light source. The wood panels activate with mechanical hums and clicks when all players have entered the theater. <em>Puppets</em> pop out of the wall and play out the story of the Wanting God of the Incoherent Sky. As the show ends the spotlight pivots to reveal the entrance into the offering room and the <em>puppets</em> reset into the wood panels.</p>

<h3 id="puppets">Puppets</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Small wooden puppets powered by magical whirring gears designed by the <em>Puppet Maker</em> to entertain guests and protect the sanctity of the theater (3a). They will attack any player that attempts to steal from or harm the <em>Puppet Maker</em> with sharp retractable knives that protrud from inside each wrist.</p>

<h2 id="b---offering">3b - Offering</h2>
<p>Any investigation into this room before the show in 3a completes is shrouded in darkness and the chest is locked. As the show completes the room lights up from a trough of fire oil lining the floor on all sides and the chest unlocks. Upon investigation the chest contains <strong>[d6 item]</strong> per player belonging to the <em>Puppet Maker</em>. Anything taken from the chest triggers the <em>puppets</em> in the theather (3a) to seek out and attack the culprit. A new item of value may be placed in the chest in tribute to the Wanting God.</p>

<h2 id="a---workshop">4a - Workshop</h2>
<p>Large tanks containing mystical energies are jumbled in the South East corner. Bulky conduits run out of each tank and along the floor into the altar (4b). The <em>Puppet Maker’s</em> large work table sits at the center covered in tools, gears, pegs, and random puppet parts. In the South West corner lies a simple cot, book shelf, and small table with a half-way melted candle.</p>
<h2 id="b---altar">4b - Altar</h2>
<p>A bundle of bulky conduits snake their way along the South wall and connect into the altar on the West wall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Puppet Maker’s</em> life work has been spent in creation of the monstrosity that lays upon the altar (4b). Standing a head higher than the tallest player it obeys the <em>Puppet Maker’s</em> commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c---storage">4c - Storage</h2>
<p>Bins of unfinshed wood scraps line the South wall. A large net containing the <em>Puppet Maker’s</em> many failed creations hangs across the ceiling. A passageway leading to the entrance (1) is accessible in the North West corner by lifting a simple latch and pusing outward on the wall.</p>
