The dungeon before you was designed to provide a simple game on a quiet night. Be warned there are no stat blocks to be found and everything was generated randomly with no playtest. It should be easy to convert for whatever your system of choice may be. Although, if I may recommend the lovely Abenteuerspeil! by Terribly Beautiful Games then everything should be good to go. Thanks for checking out my adventure.

## 1 - Entrance

Large wall sconces flank faded tapestries along the West wall. Each tapestry depicts a god figure in distinct themes of action, horror, and romance. A deep groove cut into the tile floor arcs out from the South wall where a skeleton is found clutching a piece of gold leafed parchment. A silent alarm signals the occupant of the workshop (4a) when disturbed via a near invisible filament connected to the skeleton's hand. An obsidian door with a pearl handle is set into the East wall.

- Stairs to the North descend into room 1.
- Door to the East leading into room 2.
- Skeleton alarm system.
- Secret passageway to the South leading to room 4c must be opened from the opposite side.

## 2 - Parlor

The room is dimly lit and contains multiple seating areas of various configurations atop large mismatched rugs. A mirror backed bar spans the East wall. Throughout the room mannequins are positioned individually in the acts of libation, dance, and conversation. If the alarm was triggered then the West door locks behind the party upon entering.

- Door to the West leading into room 1.
- Door to the North leading into room 3a.
- Locked door to the South leading into room 4a.
- The *Puppet Maker's* menagerie of mannequin friends.

### Puppet Maker

> The Puppet Maker resides in the workshop (4a). They will attempt to take position disguised as an additional mannequin in the parlor (2) during the play in the theater (3a). If threatened they retreat back to the workshop (4a) and lock the door. In defense the Puppet Maker will activate their ultimate creation resting on the altar (4b). Their motive is to obtain new life energy required to power the puppets.

## 3a - Theater

The room is dark. Upon entering light projects from the ceiling onto the North wall revealing a surreal scene of brightly painted characters carved into wood panels. The East corridor and beyond is not visible unless investigated with a light source. The wood panels activate with mechanical hums and clicks when all players have entered the theater. The painted characters are *puppets* that emerge from the wall and play out the story of the Wanting God of the Incoherent Sky. As the play ends the spotlight pivots to reveal the entrance into the offering room and the *puppets* reset into the wood panels.

- *Puppets* hidden in wood relief panels on the North wall.
- Short corridor to the East leading into room 3b.
- A dome mirrored on the inside mounted to the ceiling.

### Puppets

> Small wood puppets powered by magical whirring gears designed by the *Puppet Maker* to entertain guests and protect the sanctity of the theater (3a). They will attack any player that attempts to steal from or harm the *Puppet Maker* with sharp retractable knives that protrude from inside each wrist.

## 3b - Offering

Any investigation into this room before the play in 3a completes is shrouded in darkness and the chest is locked. As the play completes the room lights up from a trough of fire oil lining the floor on all sides and the chest unlocks. Upon investigation the chest contains **[d6 item]** per player belonging to the *Puppet Maker*. The chest is clearly marked that gifts for the Wanting God are greatly appreciated. Anything taken from the chest triggers the *puppets* in the theater (3a) to seek out and attack the culprit.

- Large chest of various items.
- Trough of fire oil.

| d6  | item          | description                           |
| :-: | :------------ | :------------------------------------ |
|  1  | jewel ring    | contains a purple powder              |
|  2  | hand mirror   | does not reflect the beholder         |
|  3  | silver dagger | speckled with sparkling blood         |
|  4  | leather bag   | knuckle bones engraved with runes     |
|  5  | folding fan   | depicts a pair of running bulls       |
|  6  | small cube    | puzzle box emitting a faint sound     |

## 4a - Workshop

Jumbled in the South East corner are large glass tanks that contain a dwindling supply of glowing life energy. Bulky conduit runs out of each tank and along the floor into the adjacent room (4b). The *Puppet Maker's* large work table sits at the center covered in tools and random puppet parts. In the South West corner lies a simple cot, book shelf, and small table with a half-way melted candle.

- Life energy storage tanks that are almost empty.
- Haphazard work table with scattered tools and parts.
- Books detailing puppet making and life energy storage.

## 4b - Altar

The bundle of bulky conduits snake their way along the South wall and connect into the altar on the West wall. The *Puppet Maker* uses the ancient magics imbued within the altar to harness the life energy into the mechanical creations. The *Puppet Maker's* life work has been spent in creation of the *puppet monstrosity* that lays upon the altar.

- Altar capable of transferring life energy.
- Conduits running life energy to and from the altar.

### Puppet Monstrosity

> Standing a head higher than the tallest player it obeys the *Puppet Maker's* commands. The energy tank mounted to it's back provides the massive power required to animate the body. It has great strength and is heavily armored.

## 4c - Storage

Bins of unfinished wood scraps line the South wall. A large net containing the *Puppet Maker's* many failed creations hang across the ceiling. The hidden passageway leading to the entrance (1) is accessible in the North West corner by lifting a simple latch and pushing outward on the wall.

- Hidden passageway leading to room 1.
- Net of failed creations ready to collapse.
