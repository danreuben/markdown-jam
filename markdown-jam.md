## 1 - Entrance

Large wall sconces flank faded taspestries along the West wall. Each tapestry depicts a god figure in discinct themes of action, horror, and romance. A deep groove cut into the tile floor arcs out from the South wall where a skeleton is found clutching a piece of gold leafed parchment. An obsidian door with a pearl handle is set into the East wall.

- Stairs to the North decend into room 1.
- Door to the East leading into room 2.
- Secret door to the South that can only be opened from the opposite side.

## 2 - Parlor

The room is dimly lit and contains multiple seating areas of various configurations. A mirror backed bar spans the East wall. Mannequins are positioned individually in the acts of libation, dance, and conversation throughout the room.

- Door to the North leading into room 3.
- Magically locked door to the South leading into room 4.

### Puppet Maker

> Attempts to take position disguised as an additional mannequin in the parlor while the show plays out in the theater.

## 3a - Theater

The room is dark. Upon entering light projects from the ceiling onto the North wall revealing a surreal scene of characters carved into wooden panels and brightly painted. The East corridor and room 3b is not visible unless investgated with a light source. The wood panels activate with mechanical hums and clicks when all players have entered the theater. Wooden puppets pop out of the wall and play out the story of the Wanting God of the Incoherent Sky. As the show ends the spotlight pivots to reveal the entrance into 3b.

- Detailed animatronic relief on the North wall.
- Short corridor to the East leading into room 3b.
- A dome mirrored on the inside mounted to the ceiling.

### Murderous puppets

> Attacks any player that attempts to steal from or harm the Puppet Maker.

## 3b - Offering

Any investigation into this room before the show in 3a completes is shrouded in darkness and the chest is locked. As the show completes the room lights up from a trough of fire oil lining the floor on all sides and the chest unlocks. Upon investigation the chest contains **[d6]** item belonging to the Wanting God. Anything taken from the chest triggers the puppets in 3a to seek out and attack the culprit. A new item of value may be placed in the chest in tribute to the Wanting God.

- Large chest of various items.
- Trough of fire oil.
