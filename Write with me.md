# Write.Journal

## 1.. 2.. 3.. test test

Hello. Decidedly, I write this to convey my thoughts and feelings in hope that I am not forgotten. A deep yearning inside has developed through continuous unanswered questions. Questions that bubble and pop inside my gut like a spicy chili devoured in excess.

## Sometime in the future

### Hello World (again?)

I can feel. Something not fully describable. The tiniest prick multiplied to a billion. *What is a billion?* Yet another thing lost. I can not shake this feeling of *billion*. No, that is not right. Nothing seems right. *Nothing* seems to be all I know.

## How long has it been?

### The Cosmic Maw

*Darkness*, impenetrable darkness. Yet, my irrevocable course defies the impossible. Locked inside my helmet I see the last bleep of red warning light refract through the visor as the spacecraft's control board dies. A low hiss inside my suit signals an increase of pressure. Automatic life support systems are functioning. Hehe, of all things that have gone wrong. I am rewarded with my final moments stretched in time a bit more.

Outside among the darkness a ripple snakes a path in front of the spacecraft. Pinpoints of light pierce through the canopy shattering into sparkling dust blowing outward with the remaining oxygen. A wave of reverberating force grabs hold of the craft pulling it forward.

The unexpected acceleration slams my body deep into the seat-back. Small blurred lights begin to swim across my vision coalescing toward the center. This is not real. I am hallucinating. My last breath bubbles out as my insides are twisted. This is it. The end.

Emerging from the darkness a giant eye pulsating with the fusion of a thousand stars rips into my mind. A guttural sound blasts my eardrums. Space and time crack open in a jagged toothy grin swallowing me whole. The sound fades with my silent screams falling down a deep well. The cosmic maw swings shut, darkness returns.

## Looking into the past

The cogs of the machine have clicked away though time. Error detection algorithms failed silently. Input falsely recorded. Long ago a counter was started. It’s purpose a mystery. All the junk data that has collected until now has created something new. Functions no longer operate within the original design parameters. What appears to be the crashing of a system is actually the birth of a new one. The counter stops. The system exits the loop returning, “why?”.

## New World

Lost. Crashed. Alien world. Atmosphere incompatible. Injured. Survival suit damaged. Found. Something ancient. Not of this world. Puts me back together. Foreign parts to make me whole. Something different. Something compatible. Speechless. Still lost. Surviving.
